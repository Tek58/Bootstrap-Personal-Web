                    I'm a Software Engineer, Web developr, Penetration tester and Cyber Security Analyist.
                    I have done personal and group projects which led me to become good on what I do.</p> 
                <p>
                    Being random is one of the things I hate most, I believe that everyone has the capablities to change the world if they work on it the right way. My dream is to help contribute something special to this world and be a change maker. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Everyday I try to ask my self what have I done today to acheive my Goals? and I try to contribute something eachday. 
                    There is a quote which I prefer to hear everyday "If you don't sacrifice for what you want, what you want will be the sacrifice!!"

                            “The Power of Now” was published in 1997. It is a spiritual self-help guide to help us discover our true Being, release our pain and find deep inner peace. When we are 
                            intensely present in the Now, we respond from deep consciousness and flow with ease and joy in life. In so doing, we can better fulfill our outer purpose (to achieve goals 
                            and seek to create a better world), while fulfilling our inner purpose and truly changing the world at cause.

                                This year I have decided to add full stack web development to my 
                                list of skills. Besides class courses and assistant of instructor in the school, the best way this could be achieved is through online courses and documentations. 
                                There are a lot of online course providing sites but my favorite ones are Udemy and Udacity and I have decided to take the course on Udacity because they are the one providing it for free. 
                                <br><br> Udacity is also a platform providing courses but most of them are paid and also contain the best courses anyone will want to learn because they mostly use instractors or company employees to so the videos.  Udemy is a platform where any instructor or an individual having the knowledge can share their knowledge to the course subscribers and it is the best place to get same topic in different aspect of presentation,
                                that’s why I prefer it and its mostly free courses. <br><br>
                                To see a highlight of the course, it consists of two major categories: Front end developer and Backend developer besides all that it will also focus on interfaces and
                                deployment platform compatibilities. I have provided the link to the course;
                                anyone can be enrolled and start today plus for those who want to explore more there is a link to Udemy site below this article.

                                I can completely say that I am a music person. I prefer music every time I am coding or clearing my head.
                                I believe that music has the power of giving a person the exact message they were waiting for.
                                There are times when I felt if the music was written for me only. This is something many people experience. Not only this scientifically, music’s beats have been proved to have the power to
                                add the boost needed to think outside of the box when doing calculation and math related stuffs.  <br>
                                <br> The best thing about my music is mostly I don’t limit my self on a single category or genre. 
                                I mostly enjoy most of them bust everyone have that one genre they like to hear many times, mine will be pop. Adam Lenin, Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello, Sam Smith, Eminem, Akon, Sia, Zayn, ... are some of the musician’s I
                                like. I have linked my favorite collection of music, listening to it you can determine what kind of music I like. Besides that there is a YouTube link below.<br><br>
                                Music is one of the things I like but I definitely haven said that it’s on the top of my list, I’m afraid that title goes to Movies. I like movies that I can say I can’t live without them; I am truly addicted to movies. 
                                Adventure and action are also top of my category selections. This are for movies, when it comes to Tv Series its another story. There is no category I don’t like except for standup comedies. List of my 
                                Tv series consist of: 1, Game of Thrones 2, The Legend of The Seeker 3, The Vampire diaries . . . these are the best Tv Series of all time for me.

                        sharing, group works, diversity tolerance and being a social person are some of the benefit you get for free for joining University because you will encounter a lot of behavior in the environment. <br><br>
                        University time is one of the best times I have had so far regarding friendship quality time. From all of them dorm life id the best. I have a lot of friends but the ones I dare to call my brothers are 
                        Meba, Sami, Nati, Naol and Habte. We all share the same dorm so you can Imagine the time we will have. Not only on fun times they are truly my guides, whenever one of us try to bounce of the circle in any 
                        way we all are there for each other in any way. <br><br>
                        Truly University is the place you can shape your self to be a two-sided sharp blade, both in education and in life. Not only this It is also the best place to strengthen your religion status and know more
                        because there are a lot of resources and peoples to learn from.

                        Having an author Eckhart Tolle, who is a motivational speaker and Author 
                        “The Power of Now” was published in 1997. It is a spiritual self-help guide to help us discover our true Being, release our pain and find deep inner peace. When we are 
                        intensely present in the Now, we respond from deep consciousness and flow with ease and joy in life. In so doing, we can better fulfill our outer purpose (to achieve goals 
                        and seek to create a better world), while fulfilling our inner purpose and truly changing the world at cause.

                        In this summary, we’ll outline various insights and tips about mindfulness, 
                        spiritual enlightenment and how to unlock the power of now.
